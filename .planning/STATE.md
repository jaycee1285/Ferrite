## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
- Modular Panels architecture chosen
- Single binary, all features built-in but toggleable
- Not a VSCode replacement - focused power tool
- Tokio runs in background threads, NOT main thread (egui constraint) - 06-01
- Use std::sync::mpsc for UI ↔ worker communication (cross-thread safe) - 06-01
- Feature gate async-workers (not default) for gradual rollout - 06-01
- All panel visibility fields default to false (opt-in design) - 06-02
- Added productivity_panel_visible as fourth panel type - 06-02
- Used #[serde(default)] for automatic backward compatibility - 06-02
- Lazy worker initialization: workers spawn on first panel visibility (not at startup) - 06-03
- View menu organized under "Panels" section with all four panel toggles - 06-03
- Echo Demo as AI Assistant placeholder demonstrating worker pattern - 06-03
- Use std::time::Instant instead of chrono for timer (monotonic, no clock drift) - 07-01
- Store tasks in .ferrite/tasks.json (workspace-scoped, not global config) - 07-01
- Store notes in .ferrite/notes/*.txt (one file per note, text format) - 07-01
- 1000ms default debounce for AutoSave (prevents excessive writes) - 07-01
- Use atomic write pattern from config/persistence.rs (write .bak, rename) - 07-01
- Support priority markers in markdown (! and !! prefixes) - 07-01
